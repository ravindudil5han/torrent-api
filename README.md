# Torrent-API


#### This script is a JavaScript code that uses the @dil5han/torrent-api module to create a server that can search multiple torrent websites and return the results to the client in JSON format.

The script begins by importing the necessary modules, including express, a popular web framework for Node.js, and several functions that enable it to scrape data from various torrent websites such as 1337x, Nyaa, YTS, PirateBay, TorLock, EZTVio, TorrentGalaxy, RARBG, ETTV Central, Zooqle, KickAss, BitSearch, Glodls, LimeTorrent, TorrentFunk, and TorrentProject.

After importing the necessary modules, it creates a new instance of express and sets up a route that listens to HTTP GET requests with the URL pattern /torrent/:website/:query/:page?. The :website parameter represents the name of the torrent website to be searched, while the :query parameter represents the search query string, and the optional :page parameter represents the page number of the search results to be returned.

Inside the route handler function, the script first sets the headers for allowing cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to prevent any security-related errors that may occur when a client tries to access the server from a different domain or port. It then extracts the values of the :website, :query, and :page parameters from the request object using the req.params property.

The script then checks the value of the :website parameter and calls the corresponding function from the imported modules to scrape the data from the corresponding torrent website. If the scraped data is not null and has length greater than zero, the script sends the data back to the client using the res.send() method. Otherwise, it returns an error message in JSON format that describes the reason why no search results were found.

Overall, this script provides a simple and convenient way to search multiple torrent websites using a single API endpoint. It can be useful for building torrent-related applications that require searching for torrents from multiple sources.
